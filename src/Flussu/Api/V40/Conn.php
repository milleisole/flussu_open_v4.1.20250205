/**
 * Conn.php
 * 
 * This class is used to connect to other servers via API using the "flussu" format. The process involves two 
 * main steps: authorization and execution. Initially, an authorization call is made by requesting an OTP 
 * and providing the name of the command to be executed. Following this, the execution call is made by
 * providing the OTP obtained from the first step. The server, upon receiving the OTP, executes the corresponding
 * command and returns the result. The sequence of operations is as follows:
 *
 * Usage:
 * getOTP: 
 *      Request an OTP by specifying the command name. This step is for authorization purposes.
 * getCommandFromOtp: 
 *      This step is typically part of the internal logic where the command associated with the given OTP is 
 *      retrieved, ensuring the OTP is valid and has not been used.
 * execCmd: 
 *      Execute the command by providing the OTP. The server executes the command associated with the OTP and 
 *      returns the execution result.

     * Executes a command based on the request and user context.
     * 
     * This method is responsible for processing incoming requests and executing the corresponding
     * actions based on the command ('C') and key ('K') parameters provided in the request. It handles
     * the initialization of necessary components, such as the database handler and command processor,
     * and sets up the environment for command execution, including headers for CORS and content type.
     * 
     * The method also manages the retrieval of the request body, decoding it from JSON format, and
     * prepares it for further processing by the command execution logic.
     * 
     * Usage:
     * This method is intended to be called with a Request object containing the necessary parameters
     * ('C' for command, 'K' for key) and a User object representing the current user. The method
     * determines whether the user needs to be logged in and the required authorization level based
     * on the command to be executed.

     * @param \Flussu\Flussuserver\Request $Req The HTTP request object, containing parameters and the request body.
     * @param \Flussu\Persons\User $theUser The user object representing the current user.
     * 
     * @return void The method does not return a value but sends a JSON response to the client.
     * 
     * @throws \Exception If there are issues with command execution or if the required parameters are not provided.
